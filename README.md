# Encrypted Todo List
A Web app that allows you to store todos securely using AES256 encryption.

# User Interface
You may already know from which game the user interface was imitated, I was trying to make the user interface look as similar to the CS:GO menu interface as possible.

# Setup
You start by creating a key pair that contains a key, IV, and the version of the key pair.
You can do so by pressing the *New Keypair* button and preferably storing it on a USB or in another secure place.

You now need to create the list file. This is where your encrypted todos are stored. You can do so by pressing the *New List* button when you load your keypair.

Now your todo list is set up, you now can add a new todo by pressing the *Add* button and rename the list by changing the text in the textbox near the *Add* button,
after you add your todos save them by pressing the *Save* button and overwriting the original list file or saving it as a new file.

# Future Improvements
Make the web app a PWA.
